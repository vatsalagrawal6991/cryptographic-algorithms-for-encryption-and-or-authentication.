Charizard was designed by Atsuko Nishida for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pokemon Red and Blue. Charizard was designed before Charmander, the latter being actually based on the former. Originally called lizardon in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokemon species clever and descriptive names related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. As a result, they were renamed Charizard, a portmanteau of the words charcoal or char and lizard.
